# Task1
This is a simple Python program that:

Accepts a user-defined number of elements,

Stores them in a list (array),

Displays the array before and after sorting.

# Task2a
This is a simple python program that demonstrates:

 - How to redirect printed output to a file using the `file=` parameter in `print()`.
 - How to force immediate writing to the file using the `flush=True` parameter.
 - Use of `flush` to control buffering behavior in console output.

# Task2b

This repository contain a python script that demonstrates the functionality of various types of operators in Python, including:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Special Operators

# Task3a

This simple Python program allows users to **view the calendar of any month and year** they input.
It uses Python's built-in `calendar` module to display a neatly formatted calendar in the terminal.
## Features

- Asks user for a **year** and **month (1-12)**
- Validates the input to ensure the month is within a valid range
- Displays the monthly calendar for the given inputs

# Task3b

This Python program allows users to view the **calendar for any given month and year**, using only the built-in `datetime` module — without relying on the `calendar` module.

## Features

- Prompts the user to input a year and a month (1–12)
- Calculates and prints the calendar layout for the specified month
- Handles month transitions and proper weekday alignment
- No third-party libraries required — built using only the standard `datetime` module

# task4
 This Python script demonstrates basic bitwise operations such as XOR, left shift, and right shift.
 ## Description
 The program performs the following:

  1. Initializes two integers x and y.

  2. Displays their values.

  3. Calculates and prints:

     - Bitwise XOR of x and y

     - Left shift of x by 2 positions

     - Right shift of x by 2 positions
