- Calculates and prints the calendar layout for the specified month
- Handles month transitions and proper weekday alignment
- No third-party libraries required â€” built using only the standard `datetime` module

  2. Displays their values.

  3. Calculates and prints:

     - Bitwise XOR of x and y

     - Left shift of x by 2 positions

     - Right shift of x by 2 positions

# task5

# task7a
  This Python program demonstrates how to sort a **list of tuples** based on the **second item** (typically a numeric value like marks or scores) using a **lambda function** as the sorting key.

# task7b
  ##  Python Simple Calculator using Functions and Loop

  This Python program implements a basic calculator that can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus using user-defined functions and a loop.

# task8
  ## Money & Item Operations in Python

  This Python program demonstrates **real-life object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts by modeling money transactions and item purchases using **operator overloading**.

  ##  Description

  The project contains two main classes:

  ### 1. `Money` Class
  Represents a person's money or wallet balance.

  #### Features:
  - `+` Add two money amounts
  - `-` Subtract one amount from another
  - `*` Multiply a money amount by a number (e.g., double the money)
  - Custom string representation using `__str__`

  ### 2. `Item` Class
  Represents a purchasable item with a fixed price.

  #### Features:
  - `*` Multiply the price of the item with a quantity to return the total cost (as a `Money` object)
  - Custom string representation using `__str__`
# task9
  ## Fruit Count Visualization Using Matplotlib
    This Python project uses `matplotlib` to visually represent the count of different fruits using three types of charts:
      - Line Plot
      - Pie Chart
      - Bar Chart
# task10
  ## Streamlit Plots Using Matplotlib
    This Streamlit web app demonstrates how to create a **2x2 subplot layout** using Matplotlib to visualize insights from the `tip.csv` dataset.

  The app includes:
    - Histogram of total bills
    - Boxplot of tips
    - Pie chart of gender distribution
    - Bar chart of average total bill by day

# task11
  ### This Python script performs a series of text preprocessing tasks on raw input data. It uses the `re` (regular expressions) module to identify and clean specific patterns in the text, such as dates, email addresses, excessive spaces, emojis, and more.
#### ðŸ“Œ Features

The script performs the following cleaning operations **in sequence**:

1. **Extract and remove numeric dates**  
   Matches and removes dates in the format:  
   - `dd/mm/yyyy`  
   - `yyyy-mm-dd`  
   - `dd-mm-yyyy`

2. **Remove textual (written) date formats**  
   Example:  
   - `July 4, 2025`  
   - `Dec 25, 2024`  
   Supports both full and short month names.

3. **Remove email addresses**  
   Specifically targets emails ending in `.com`.

4. **Remove emojis and non-ASCII characters**  
   Removes any Unicode characters outside the standard ASCII range.

5. **Simplify excessive punctuation**  
   Converts repeated punctuation (e.g., `!!!` or `...`) into a single character (e.g., `!`, `.`).

6. **Normalize whitespace**  
   Replaces multiple spaces or newlines with a single space.

# task12
